H5hut is a veneer API for HDF5: H5hut files are also valid HDF5 files
and are compatible with other HDF5-based interfaces and tools. For
example, the h5dump tool that comes standard with HDF5 can export H5hut
files to ASCII or XML for additional portability. H5hut also includes
tools to convert H5hut data to the  Visualization ToolKit (VTK) format
and to generate scripts for the  GNUplot data plotting tool.
