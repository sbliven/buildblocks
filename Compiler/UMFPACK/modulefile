UMFPACK is a set of routines for solving unsymmetric sparse linear systems,
Ax=b, using the Unsymmetric MultiFrontal method. Written in ANSI/ISO C, with
a MATLAB (Version 6.0 and later) interface. Appears as a built-in routine
(for lu, backslash, and forward slash) in MATLAB. Includes a MATLAB
interface, a C-callable interface, and a Fortran-callable interface. Note
that "UMFPACK" is pronounced in two syllables, "Umph Pack". It is not "You
Em Ef Pack".
