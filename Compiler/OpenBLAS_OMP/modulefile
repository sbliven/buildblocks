The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide
standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix operations.
The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector operations, the
Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and the Level 3 BLAS perform
matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS are efficient, portable, and
widely available, they are commonly used in the development of high quality
linear algebra software, LAPACK for example.

LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is written in Fortran 90 and provides
routines for solving systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-
squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems,
and singular value problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU,
Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are
related computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and
estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled, but
not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality is
provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.
