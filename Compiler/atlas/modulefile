The ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) project is an
ongoing research effort focusing on applying empirical techniques in
order to provide portable performance. At present, it provides C and
Fortran77 interfaces to a portably efficient BLAS implementation, as
well as a few routines from LAPACK.
