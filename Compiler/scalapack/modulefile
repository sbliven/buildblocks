ScaLAPACK, version 2.0, includes routines for the solution of dense,
band, and tridiagonal linear systems of equations, condition estimation and
iterative refinement, for LU and Cholesky factorization, matrix inversion,
full-rank linear least squares problems, orthogonal and generalized orthogonal
factorizations, orthogonal transformation routines, reductions to upper
Hessenberg, bidiagonal and tridiagonal form, reduction of a symmetric-definite/
Hermitian-definite generalized eigenproblem to standard form, the
symmetric/Hermitian, divide-and-conquer symmetric/Hermitian, generalized
symmetric/Hermitian and the nonsymmetric eigenproblem, and the singular value
decomposition.  With the exception of the singular value decomposition,
most routines are available in four types: single precision real, double
precision real, single precision complex, and double precision complex.
