LAPACK is written in Fortran 90 and provides routines for solving
systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions
of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular
value problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky,i
QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related
computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and
estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled,
but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality
is provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and double
precision.

This modules also includes the C-bindings in the library liblapack.a
and the BLAS library libcblas.a.
