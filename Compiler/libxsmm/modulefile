LIBXSMM is a library for specialized dense and sparse matrix operations
as well as for deep learning primitives such as small convolutions
targeting Intel Architecture. Small marix multiplication kernels (SMMs)
are generated for Intel SSE,  Intel AVX, Intel AVX2, and Intel AVX-512
as found in the Intel Xeon Phi processor family (KNL, KNM) and Intel
Xeon processors (SKX). Highly optimized code for small convolutions
is targeting Intel AVX2 and Intel AVX-512, whereas other targets can
automatically leverage specialized SMMs to perform convolutions.
