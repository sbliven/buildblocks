AreTomo3 is a multi-GPU accelerated software package that enables real-time
fully automated reconstruction of cryoET tomograms in parallel with cryoET data
collection. Integrating MotionCor3, AreTomo2, and GCtfFind in a single
application, AreTomo3 has established an autonomous preprocessing pipeline
that, whenever a new tilt series is collected, can activate and repeat itself
from correction of beam induced motion and assembling tilt series to CTF
estimation and correction, tomographic alignment, and 3D reconstruction
throughout entire session of data collection without human intervention. The
end results include not only tomograms but also a rich set of alignment
parameters to bootstrap subtomogram averaging. Our test shows that AreTomo3 can
catch up to 9-target PACE Tomo data collection with 4 NVidia RTX A6000 GPUs
when it was configured to perform 2D local motion correction on movies and 3D
local motion correction on tilt series. The offline testing shows that AreTomo3
runs faster than the data collection. As a result, GPU resources can be shared
with other tasks to expand the preprocessing capacity. Tomogram denoising and
particle picking now can run concurrently with AreTomo3 to maximize the
preprocessing workflow.
