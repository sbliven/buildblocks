module-help         "
Single Particle spIsoNet (spIsoNet) is designed to correct for the preferred
orientation problem in cryoEM by self-supervised deep learning, by recovering
missing information from well-sampled orientations in Fourier space. Unlike
conventional supervised deep learning methods that need explicit input-output
pairs for training, spIsoNet autonomously extracts supervisory signals from the
original data, ensuring the reliability of the information used for training.
