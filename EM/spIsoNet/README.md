# spIsoNet

Single Particle spIsoNet (spIsoNet) is designed to correct for the preferred orientation problem in cryoEM by self-supervised deep learning, by recovering missing information from well-sampled orientations in Fourier space.

Unlike conventional supervised deep learning methods that need explicit input-output pairs for training, spIsoNet autonomously extracts supervisory signals from the original data, ensuring the reliability of the information used for training.
