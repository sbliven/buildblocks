# Relion

## Installation

Relion is installed from git. The ./build script should work for both stable
(tags) and unstable (branches) versions. It should be run on Merlin6 from an
admin account.

Currently only gcc/7.4.0 is used. Better performance is reported with intel icc
and MKL, but this would require additional openmpi variants.
