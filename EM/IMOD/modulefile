IMOD is a set of image processing, modeling and display programs used for tomographic
reconstruction and for 3D reconstruction of EM serial sections and optical sections.
The package contains tools for assembling and aligning data within multiple types and
sizes of image stacks, viewing 3-D data from any orientation, and modeling and display
of the image files. IMOD was developed primarily by David Mastronarde, Rick Gaudette,
Sue Held, Jim Kremer, Quanren Xiong, and John Heumann at the University of Colorado.

The development of IMOD has been supported by grants from the National Center for
Research Resources, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, and the National
Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.  IMOD and virtually all programs
contained within the IMOD package are Copyright (c) 1994-2017 by the Regents of the
University of Colorado.  Other contributors are acknowledged in our Copyright and
