# ProteinMPNN

ProteinMPNN is a deep learning-based Python module for inverse protein folding. It designs amino acid sequences that fold into a given protein backbone structure. The model uses a graph neural network to predict sequences efficiently and accurately, making it useful for protein design tasks in research and synthetic biology.
