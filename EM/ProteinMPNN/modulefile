module-help "
ProteinMPNN is a deep learning-based Python module for inverse protein folding.
It designs amino acid sequences that fold into a given protein backbone
structure. The model uses a graph neural network to predict sequences
efficiently and accurately, making it useful for protein design tasks in
research and synthetic biology.
