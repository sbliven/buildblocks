AlphaFold3 is a deep learning model developed by DeepMind that predicts the 3D
structure of not just proteins (like AlphaFold2) but also DNA, RNA, ligands,
and other molecules in complex biological systems. It significantly improves
accuracy in modeling protein–protein, protein–nucleic acid, and protein–ligand
interactions.
