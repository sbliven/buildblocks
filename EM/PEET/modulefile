PEET (Particle Estimation for Electron Tomography) is an open-source package
for aligning and averaging particles in 3-D subvolumes extracted from
tomograms. It seeks the optimal alignment of each particle against a
reference volume through several iterations. If PEET and IMOD are both
installed, most PEET operations are available from the eTomo graphical
user interface in IMOD. PEET uses the parallel processing framework
within IMOD, so that the lengthy computations can be distributed to
multiple cores on one computer, to a set of linked workstations, or to
a cluster. PEET is written in Matlab and a compiled version is
distributed along with the Matlab runtime environment needed to run it.
