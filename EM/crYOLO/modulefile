CrYOLO is a fast and accurate particle picking procedure. It's based on
convolutional neural networks and utilizes the popular You Only Look Once
(YOLO) object detection system.

  * crYOLO makes picking fast – On a modern GPU it will pick your particles at
    up to 6 micrographs per second.
  * crYOLO makes picking smart – The network learns the context of particles
    (e.g. not to pick particles on carbon or within ice contamination )
  * crYOLO makes training easy – You might use a general network model and skip
    training completely. However, if the general model doesn't give you
    satisfactory results or if you would like to improve them, you might want
    to train a specialized model specific for your data set by selecting
    particles (no selection of negative examples necessary) on a small number
    of micrographs.
