OpenJDK is the free, open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard
Edition (Java SE) that serves as the reference implementation for Java. It is a
community-driven project, initially started by Sun Microsystems and now
maintained by Oracle, Red Hat, and others, and is licensed under the GNU
General Public License (GPL). Many Linux distributions use OpenJDK as their
default Java SE implementation, and it can be used to build other Java
platforms.
