The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is a high-level modeling 
system for mathematical programming and optimization. It consists of a
language compiler and a stable of integrated high-performance solvers.
GAMS is tailored for complex, large scale modeling applications, and
allows you to build large maintainable models that can be adapted 
quickly to new situations. GAMS is specifically designed for modeling 
linear, nonlinear and mixed integer optimization problems.
