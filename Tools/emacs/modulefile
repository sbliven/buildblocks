GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor—and more. At its
core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming
language with extensions to support text editing. The features of GNU
Emacs include:

 -  Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a
    variety of file types including plain text, source code, and HTML.
 
 -  Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new users.

 -  Full Unicode support for nearly all human languages and their scripts.

 -  Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical interface.

 -  A large number of extensions that add other functionality, including
    a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger interface, calendar,
    and more. Many of these extensions are distributed with GNU Emacs;
    others are available separately.
