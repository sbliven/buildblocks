GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or
more computers. A job can be a single command or a small script that has
to be run for each of the lines in the input. The typical input is a list
of files, a list of hosts, a list of users, a list of URLs, or a list of
tables. A job can also be a command that reads from a pipe. GNU parallel
can then split the input and pipe it into commands in parallel.
