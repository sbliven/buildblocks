HDFView is a visual tool written in Java for browsing and editing HDF
(HDF5 and HDF4) files. Using HDFView, you can:

 - View a file hierarchy in a tree structure
 - Create new files, add or delete groups and datasets
 - View and modify the content of a dataset
 - Add, delete and modify attributes

HDFView uses the Java HDF Object Package, which implements HDF4 and HDF5
data objects in an object-oriented form.
