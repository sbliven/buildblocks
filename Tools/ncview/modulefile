Ncview is a visual browser for netCDF format files. Typically you would
use ncview to get a quick and easy, push-button look at your netCDF files.
You can view simple movies of the data, view along various dimensions,
take a look at the actual data values, change color maps, invert the data,
etc. It runs on UNIX platforms under X11, R4 or higher. For more information,
please read \$NCVIEW_DIR/share/doc/ncview/README.
