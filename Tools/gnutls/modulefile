GnuTLS is a secure communications library implementing the SSL, TLS and
DTLS protocols and technologies around them. It provides a simple C
language application programming interface (API) to access the secure
communications protocols as well as APIs to parse and write X.509,
PKCS #12, and other required structures.

The project strives to provide a secure communications back-end, simple
to use and integrated with the rest of the base Linux libraries. A back-
end designed to work and be secure out of the box, keeping the complexity
of TLS and PKI out of application code.
