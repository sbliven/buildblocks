module-help		"aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are
HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent, and Metalink. aria2 can download a
file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum
download bandwidth. It supports downloading a file from
HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP and BitTorrent at the same time, while the data
downloaded from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent
swarm. Using Metalink's chunk checksums, aria2 automatically validates
chunks of data while downloading a file like BitTorrent.

PSI compilations do not include bittorrent or metalink support.
