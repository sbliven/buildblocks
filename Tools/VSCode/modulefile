Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor
which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and
Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript
and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages
(such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET
and Unity). Begin your journey with VS Code with these introductory
