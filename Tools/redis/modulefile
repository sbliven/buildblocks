Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store used
as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. Redis provides
data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range
queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes, and streams. Redis has
built-in replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions, and different
levels of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis
Sentinel and automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.
