GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the same way across
diverse environments, such as Emacs editor, Vi editor, Less viewer, Bash
shell, various web browsers, etc. You can locate specified tags, such as
functions, macros, structs, classes, in your source files and move there
easily. It is useful for hacking large projects which contain many
sub-directories, many #ifdef and many main() functions. It is similar to
ctags or etags, but is different from them at the point of independence of
any editor. It runs on a UNIX (POSIX) compatible operating system, like GNU
and BSD.
