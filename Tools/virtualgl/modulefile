module-help "
VirtualGL is an open-source software package that allows hardware-accelerated
3D rendering for remote display environments like VNC or X11 forwarding. It
works by redirecting an application's 3D rendering commands from a client
machine to a powerful server with a 3D accelerator. The server performs the
rendering, and VirtualGL streams the resulting images back to the client for
display, enabling high-performance 3D applications on less-powerful or thin
clients.
