# VirtualGL 

VirtualGL is an open-source software package that allows hardware-accelerated 3D rendering for remote display environments like VNC or X11 forwarding. It works by redirecting an application's 3D rendering commands from a client machine to a powerful server with a 3D accelerator. The server performs the rendering, and VirtualGL streams the resulting images back to the client for display, enabling high-performance 3D applications on less-powerful or thin clients.
