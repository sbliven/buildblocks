SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and
C++ with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. It
works by taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using
them to generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to access
the underlying C/C++ code. In addition, SWIG provides a variety of
customization features that let you tailor the wrapping process to suit
your application.
