Gnuplot is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux,
OS/2, MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code
is copyrighted but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for
it). It was originally created to allow scientists and students to
visualize mathematical functions and data interactively, but has grown
to support many non-interactive uses such as web scripting. It is also
used as a plotting engine by third-party applications like Octave.
Gnuplot has been supported and under active development since 1986.
