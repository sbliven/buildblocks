GDR COPY is a fast copy library from NVIDIA, used to transfer files 
between the host and the GPU.  Communication libraries (MVAPICH2, UCX)
can take advantage of GDRCopy. if available on the systems.

While GPUDirect RDMA is meant for direct access to GPU memory from 
third-party devices, it is possible to use these same APIs to create
perfectly valid CPU mappings of the GPU memory.

The advantage of a CPU driven copy is the very small overhead involved.
That might be useful when low latencies are required.

To use it, please check whether the GDR COPY module is loaded on the
involed machines.
