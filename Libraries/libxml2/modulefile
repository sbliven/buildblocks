Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project
(but usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software available
under the MIT License. XML itself is a metalanguage to design markup
languages, i.e. text language where semantic and structure are added to
the content using extra markup information enclosed between angle
brackets. HTML is the most well-known markup language. Though the library
is written in C a variety of language bindings make it available in other
environments.
