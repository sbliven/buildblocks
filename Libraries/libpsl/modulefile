A Public Suffix List is a collection of Top Level Domains (TLDs) suffixes.
TLDs include Global Top Level Domains (gTLDs) like .com and .net; Country
Top Level Domains (ccTLDs) like .de and .cn; and Brand Top Level Domains
like .apple and .google. Brand TLDs allows users to register their own 
top level domain that exist at the same level as ICANN's gTLDs. Brand TLDs
are sometimes referred to as Vanity Domains.
