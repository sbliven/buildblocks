GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on
signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. There is
no practical limit to the precision except the ones implied by the available
memory in the machine GMP runs on. GMP has a rich set of functions, and the
functions have a regular interface.
