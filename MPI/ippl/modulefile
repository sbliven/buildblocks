IPPL is an object-oriented framework for particle based applications in
computational science requiring high-performance parallel computers. It
is a library of C++ classes designed to represent common abstractions in
these applications. IPPL is based on data-parallel programming at the
highest abstraction layer. Codes developed on serial workstations port
to all supported architectures, including parallel processors.
