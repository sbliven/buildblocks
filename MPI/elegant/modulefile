module-help	"
elegant is an accelerator modeling code that performs many functions. Its
basic function is 6D tracking, which it performs using matrices (up to
second order), symplectic integration, numerical integration, or a user-
defined mixture. It computes Twiss parameters, transport matrices, radiation
integrals, correction matrices, amplification factors, and floor coordinates.
It also performs optimization, including optimization of radiation integrals,
floor coordinates, transport matrices, and beam properties from tracking. A
number of time-dependent elements are supported, such as rf cavities, kickers,
and ramping machines. The code provides simulation of various collective
effects, such as wakes and coherent synchrotron radiation.
