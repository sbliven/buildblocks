module-help		"
SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of large,
sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high performance
machines. The library is written in C and is callable from either C or
Fortran. The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with
partial pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square
matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering for
sparsity is completely separate from the factorization.  Working
precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative backward
error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.
