module-help		"
ParMETIS is an MPI-based parallel library that implements a variety of
algorithms for partitioning unstructured graphs, meshes, and for computing
fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices. ParMETIS extends the functioni-
ality provided by METIS and includes routines that are especially suited
for parallel AMR computations and large scale numerical simulations. The
algorithms implemented in ParMETIS are based on the parallel multilevel
k-way graph-partitioning, adaptive repartitioning, and parallel multi-
constrained partitioning schemes developed in our lab.
