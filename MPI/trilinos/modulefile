Trilinos is a collection of open source software libraries, called packages,
intended to be used as building blocks for the development of scientific
applications. The word \"Trilinos\" is Greek and conveys the idea of \"a string
of pearls,\" suggesting a number of software packages linked together by a
common infrastructure. Trilinos was developed at Sandia National Laboratories
from a core group of existing algorithms, and utilizes the functionality of
software interfaces such as the BLAS, LAPACK, and MPI.
