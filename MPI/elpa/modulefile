The computation of selected or all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a
symmetric (Hermitian) matrix has high relevance for various scientific
disciplines.

For the calculation of a significant part of the eigensystem typically
direct eigensolvers are used. For large problems, the eigensystem
calculations with existing solvers can become the computational
bottleneck.

As a consequence, the ELPA project was initiated with the aim to
develop and implement an efficient eigenvalue solver for petaflop
applications, supported by the German Federal Government, through
BMBF Grant 01IH08007, from Dec 2008 to Nov 2011.

The challenging task has been addressed through a multi-disciplinary
consortium of partners with complementary skills in different areas.

As project outcome, the highly scalable and efficient direct eigen-
solvers LPA have been developed. The ELPA library was publicly
released in May 2011.

Since the end of BMBF Grant 01IH08007 in Nov 2011, the ELPA library
has been maintained by RZG - renamed to MPCDF in 2015.

Through the BMBF Grant 01IH15001 (Project ELPA-AEO from Feb 2016 to
Jan 2019) the ELPA library could be further optimized, enhanced and
ported to new architectures.
