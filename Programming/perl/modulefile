Perl 5 is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with
over 29 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
portables to mainframes and is suitable for both rapid prototyping
and large scale development projects.

'Perl' is a family of languages, 'Perl 6' is part of the family, but
it is a separate language which has its own development team. Its
existence has no significant impact on the continuing development of
'Perl 5'.
